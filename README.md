# Dengjen

[Project board](https://github.com/orgs/ZirekHQ/projects/1) — live roadmap and status for this repo's issues.

A cross-platform Rust engine for neural TTS models.

## Features

* **Models**: [Piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper), [Kokoro](https://github.com/hexgrad/kokoro), and [MeloTTS](https://github.com/myshell-ai/MeloTTS) ONNX voices
* **Phonemization**: eSpeak-ng (100+ languages, IPA output) and Arabic diacritization via `libtashkeel`
* **Multi-speaker voices**: select by `speaker_id`
* **Streaming synthesis**: chunked output (`chunk_size`/`chunk_padding`) and a realtime gRPC stream
* **Prosody control**: rate, pitch, and volume via `dengjen-sonic-sys` (libsonic)
* **Synthesis modes**: lazy, parallel, and batched, selectable per request; realtime for the voices that support it
* **Bindings**: native Rust, C-API (`libdengjen`), Python (`pydengjen`), Go and Java bindings over the C API (see `bindings/go` and `bindings/java`), gRPC (any language over the wire), and a CLI

RHVoice-style formant/statistical synthesis is a different synthesis paradigm from
this engine's neural-ONNX pipeline and isn't planned.

## What each model supports

|  | Piper | Kokoro | MeloTTS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lazy, parallel, batched modes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Realtime streaming | Voices whose manifest sets `"streaming": true` | Yes, by chunking an already synthesized sentence | No |
| Speakers | Manifest speaker map | Presets from the manifest's `voices` list | Manifest speaker map |
| Rate, pitch, volume, silence | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Tunable inference knobs | `noise_scale`, `length_scale`, `noise_w` | None | `noise_scale`, `length_scale`, `noise_scale_w` |
| Phonemizers | eSpeak-ng, raw text, Hebrew, pinyin; Arabic diacritization via `libtashkeel` | eSpeak-ng, fixed to `en-US` | eSpeak-ng (`en`, `es`, `fr`, `ja`, `ko`) or pinyin (`zh`) |

The Hebrew and pinyin phonemizers are opt-in Cargo features (`hebrew`, `pinyin`) that no frontend in this repository enables, so the prebuilt `dengjen-tts-grpc` server and the `pydengjen` wheels do not include them; embedding the Rust crates lets you enable them. Arabic diacritization (the `tashkeel` feature) is enabled by default in every frontend this repository publishes.
